# üß¨ Introduction to Cancer Biology

Welcome to the **Introduction to Cancer Biology** course repository! This online course is structured to give participants a deep understanding of cancer biology, exploring everything from fundamental principles to advanced research topics. Each week, we will cover different aspects of cancer biology, from cellular mechanisms to therapeutic strategies.

## üìÖ Course Overview

- **Duration**: 6 weeks
- **Weekly Lecture**: One 3-hour session covering core concepts
- **Advanced Topics**: One 1-hour session each week for in-depth discussions on specialized topics
- **One-on-One Meetings**: Available upon request for personalized guidance or deeper exploration of topics

This course aims to equip you with knowledge and insights that will enable you to understand and interpret cancer biology research effectively. The course materials, assignments, and interactive sessions are designed to ensure a solid grasp of key topics and the latest developments in the field.

## üë®‚Äçüè´ Course Instructor

### Mohmed Abdalfttah

Mohmed Abdalfttah is a passionate researcher in cancer biology and systems immunology, with expertise in single-cell and spatial genomics. His journey in science began in Egypt, where he was born in November 1998. He earned his **Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Biotechnology** from Ain Shams University in June 2021. Shortly after, Mohmed undertook an internship in the **Computational Epigenomics lab** at Helmholtz Zentrum M√ºnchen, focusing on cell-cell communication using both bulk and single-cell transcriptomic data.

In 2022, he joined the **Single Cell Genomics lab** at the National Center for Genomic Analysis (CNAG) in Barcelona, working on groundbreaking projects involving **breast cancer** and **brain metastasis**, with a focus on the tumor microenvironment. He continued his academic journey in 2023 at the **Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (BIST)**, completing his Master‚Äôs thesis on the tumor microenvironment in colorectal cancer in the **Colorectal Cancer lab** at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB).

Currently, Mohmed is a PhD student at the **brain metastasis lab at the National Cancer Research Center (CNIO)**, where he delves into cancer cell heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment, using cutting-edge single-cell and spatial transcriptomics methods.
